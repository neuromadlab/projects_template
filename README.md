# FOLDERS ORGANISATION:

Each task should have a dedicated folder with a separate README.md file containing (see Tasks/Body_Silhouette_Task/ for an example):
- a task description, 
- reference of existing versions,
- necessary tools to run the task,
- outputs,
- settings and/or modifications

Within each task folder there are different subtasks:

- project_versions: it contains subfolders for each project involving the task with the respective script versions
- current_version: the most up-to-date version of the task
- dev_version: development version of the task
- analysis scripts: it contains scripts for data preprocessing and wrapping (this folder should also contain a README file explaining the type of analyses and the content of each analysis document).

This main README file should be kept updated with a brief description of what each folder contains and how to navigate the folder.
