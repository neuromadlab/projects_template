# TEMPLATE ORGANISATION:

Each task should have its won folder with the complete name of the task (e.g.: "Effort_Allocation_Task") separated by underscores ("_"). It should also have a separate README.md file containing (see Tasks/Body_Silhouette_Task/ for an example):
- a task description, 
- reference of existing versions,
- necessary tools to run the task,
- outputs,
- settings and/or modifications

Within each folder there is a subfolder for each project that uses that task (e.g.: "EAT_TUE004").

This task-by-project folder should contain files with the different development versions of the task (e.g.: "EAT_TUE00x_v1") and the stable version (e.g.: "EAT_TUE00x_stable").

Another subfolder should contain all the analyses run for that specific task and project. This folder should also contain a README file explaining the type of analyses and the content of each analysis document.

This main README file should be kept updated with a breif description of what each file contains and how to navigate the folder.
