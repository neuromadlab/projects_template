Template for projects organisation and sharing

# TEMPLATE ORGANISATION:

Each task should have its won folder with the complete name of the task (e.g.: "Effort_Allocation_Task") separated by underscores ("_").

Within each folder there is a subfolder for each project that uses that task (e.g.: "EAT_TUE004").

Within this task-by-project folder we always include a README file indicating the purpose of each file contained in the folder (N.B.: remember to update this README file each time you make changes to the folder).

The folder should also contain files with the different development versions of the task (e.g.: "EAT_TUE00x_v1") and the stable version (e.g.: "EAT_TUE00x_stable").

Another subfolder should contain all the analyses run for that specific task and project. The analyses folder should also contain a README file explaining the type of analyses and the content of each analysis document.
